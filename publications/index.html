          <h3>Cancer Incidence Data at the ZCTA Level in the U.S. Interpolated by Multi-Constraint Monte Carlo
            Simulation</h3>
          <p><em>Scientific Data, 2025</em></p>
          <p>High-quality cancer data are fundamental for public health research and policy, but cancer data for small
            geographic units and population subgroups in the United States are rarely available due to small-sample
            suppression rules, spatial coarsening, and data incompleteness. These limitations hinder high-resolution
            spatial analyses and precision public health interventions. This study provides a high-resolution cancer
            incidence dataset for the U.S., generated through a multi-constraint Monte Carlo simulation framework that
            reconstructs suppressed county-level cancer data and systematically disaggregates them to ZIP Code
            Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), guided by demographic constraints. This method integrates population subgroup
            structures and macro-level incidence rates as constraints, ensuring consistency and reliability across
            spatial scales. The resulting dataset spans multiple geographic units, from state and county levels to
            ZCTAs, enabling comprehensive analyses of cancer burden, in-depth spatial analyses, and precision public
            health interventions across multiple scales..</p>

          <h3>Delineating urban agglomeration regions in China by network community scanning: Structures and policy
            implications</h3>
          <p><em>Cities, 2025</em></p>
          <p>This study employs the network community scanning (NCS) method to analyze inter-city human flow network
            patterns using the most recent 2023 Baidu mobility data in China. Specifically, it uses the Community
            Multiresolution Overlap Scan (CMOS) technique to define regions comparable to the recently government
            designated urban agglomerations (UAs) and other administrative units (i.e., economic regions and provincial
            units) so that the delineated and targeted regions overlap most. The results reveal a larger spatial context
            for multiple UAs to interact as well as a centric structure to detect within each UA. By comparing
            designated UAs and the NCS-derived comparable regions, it largely validates the rationale of UAs. More
            in-depth examination reveals discrepancies on a finer scale. Based on community affiliation index (CAI) and
            PageRank centrality, the centric structure analysis of designated UAs identifies whether an UA is absent of
            any central city, led by a dominant center, or jointly anchored by multiple centers. The efficient network
            delineation algorithm supported by timely mining of big data enables policy makers to examine the
            hierarchical structure of cities in real time and make necessary adjustments.</p>

          <h3>A multi-constraint Monte Carlo Simulation approach to downscaling cancer data</h3>
          <p><em>Health & Place, 2025</em></p>
          <p>This study employs an innovative multi-constraint Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate suppressed
            county-level cancer counts for population subgroups and extend the downscaling from county to ZIP Code
            Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in the U.S. Given the known cancer counts at a higher geographic level and larger
            demographic groups at the same geographic level as constraints, this method uses the population structure as
            probability in the Monte Carlo simulation process to estimate suppressed data entries. It not only ensures
            consistency across various data levels but also accounts for demographic structure that drives varying
            cancer risks. The 2016â€“2020 cancer incidence data from the Utah Cancer Registry is used to validate our
            approach. The method yields results with high precision and consistency across the full urban-rural
            continuum, and significantly outperforms several machine-learning models such as Random Forest and Extreme
            Gradient Boosting.</p>

          <h3>Detect cross-boundary regional collaboration in China using network community scanning and human mobility
            data</h3>
          <p><em>Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 2025</em></p>
          <p>Accurately identifying and analyzing cross-boundary regional cooperation remains challenging due to
            administrative constraints and data limitations. This study utilizes high-resolution human mobility data,
            network community scanning (NCS), and association rule mining to examine trans-provincial cooperation across
            369 Chinese cities, leveraging Location-Based Services (LBS) data from 1.3 billion users. The findings
            indicate that border-adjacent cooperation dominates trans-provincial interactions in China, while
            non-adjacent cooperation is embedded within broader cooperative networks formed through adjacent ties
            reinforcing the interwoven nature of cross-administrative collaborations. Additionally, emerging cooperative
            clusters extend beyond officially designated urban agglomerations, revealing unrecognized regional synergies
            not yet captured in planning frameworks. These results highlight discrepancies between actual collaboration
            linkages and government-defined regional plans, underscoring the need for adaptive, data-driven policymaking

          <h3>Cross-State Travel for Cancer Care and Implications for Telehealth Reciprocity</h3>
          <p><em>JAMA Network Open, 2025</em></p>
          <p>This cross-sectional study analyzed fee-for-service Medicare claims data
            for beneficiaries (aged â‰¥66 years) with a diagnosis of breast, colon, lung, or pancreatic cancer between
            January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. Analyses were performed between January 1 and July 30, 2024.
            The primary outcome of interest was receipt of cancer care across state lines.
            Frequencies of cancer services (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) were summarized by cancer type in
            relation to in-state vs out-of-state receipt of care based on state of residence for Medicare beneficiaries.
            Cross-state delivery of cancer services was also quantified by adjacent vs nonadjacent states and overall
            between-state flows for service utilization.The study included 1â€¯040â€¯874 Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.
            The mean (SD) age of the study
            population was 76.5 (7.4) years. Most patients were female (68.2%) and urban residing (78.5%); one-quarter
            (25.9%) were aged between 70 and 74 years. In terms of race and ethnicity, 7.0% of patients identified as
            Black, 3.4% as Hispanic, and 85.5% as White. Overall, approximately 6.9% of cancer care was delivered across
            state lines, with the highest proportion (8.3%) occurring for surgical care, followed by radiation (6.7%)
            and chemotherapy (5.6%) services. Out of all cross-state care, 68.4% occurred in adjacent states. Frequency
            of cross-state cancer care increased with patient rurality. Compared with urban-residing patients, isolated
            rural-residing patients were 2.5 times more likely to cross state lines for surgical procedures (18.5% vs
            7.5%), 3 times more likely to cross state lines for radiation therapy services (16.9% vs 5.7%), and almost 4
            times more likely to cross state lines for chemotherapy services (16.3% vs 4.2%).
            In this cross-sectional study of Medicare claims data, a notable proportion of
            cancer services occurred across state lines, particularly for rural-residing patients. These results
            highlight the need for cross-state telehealth policies that recognize the prevalence of care delivery from
            geographically distant specialized oncology services..</p>
